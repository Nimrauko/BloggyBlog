Representative Horton,
Shreveport Native here. Jewish from a mixed faith family. We have Atheists, Catholics, Baptists, Pentecostals, Anglicans and Pagans. All sorts. I am not someone who denigrates those of faith. I do take issue with Politicians politicizing Religion to suit their agendas. 

I see you mentioned that "Faith is the basis of all the laws in Louisiana". That is an absolute crock. Napoleonic Law is the basis of most of the laws in Louisiana. When our founders founded this nation they specifically enshrined the notion of separation of Church and State. Not to attack those of faith, but rather to protect people of all faiths from being attacked and coerced by a national religion.

Now as a Republican your party has attempted to adopt some of my Libertarian Party principles as your own. Such as being for Freedom! Freedom of Speech (Unless you're queer or a person of color, then we will ban your speech) Freedom of Religion, unless you're not a Christian. See you guys get that so wrong. It should be Freedom FROM Religion. 

You are entitled to your faith. If you want your children to learn about the Bible and the 10 commandments, that is also well and good!! Teach them that at home, or in Sunday School. But religion is NOT something that should be in the School House. Especially the ill-funded Schools in the state of Louisiana. I had a Geography teacher who pronounced Nigeria exactly how you should NOT pronounce it. So I am to trust that same individual to give seminary level theocratic education to our youth? No thank you.

Rather than pushing performative bullshit legislation through like this, that you know will be struck down in the courts costing the tax payer in the end, you could instead pursue legislation that benefits the state of Louisiana! Not just Republicans. But ALL of Louisiana. 

Address the G-d awful state of the roads, especially in NW LA where you are. Or the fact that people are moving out of Louisiana, especially the Shreveport Metro, at an alarming rate because there is no opportunity left here anymore. And it is in part due to the Politicians, like yourself, lining your pockets and selling the average citizen down the river.

But I don't think you wish to act in good faith Ms Horton. I think you are well content to court right wing special interests and to hell with the little man, except when you want to get them riled up like with this feeble attempt to make a "War on Christianity" type situation. 

"Since I was in Kindergarten, it was always on the wall. I learned there was a g-d, and I knew to honor him and his laws". Yeah that private school education served you quite well. Also why were you learning about G-d at school and not at home? Were your parents not also upstanding Christian citizens? Just wondering.

I doubt this will reach your eyes, or if it does I am sure you will not care. But I had to say it anyway. You never know when Pharohs heart will soften.
